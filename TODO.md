- Document all remaining filters and functions with docstrings
- Collate the scientific discussions to be had, including the TBC QC filter, with responsible scientists (these are for a future release)
- Complete implementation of unit tests for DVFilter
- Expose additional args to user from DVFilter
- Run prerelease over many samples
- update README w.r.t to new filter and changes in filter code reporting
- bump version w.r.t to new filter, and new archtype - since filter reporting is not backwards compatible, this is probably a bump of a major version
