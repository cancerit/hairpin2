- Document all remaining filters and functions with docstrings
- Collate the scientific discussions to be had, including the TBC QC filter, with responsible scientists (these are for a future release)
- implement DVF filter read ratio threshold and expose as user param
- Run prerelease over many samples
- update README w.r.t to new filter and changes in filter code reporting
- bump version w.r.t to new filter, and new archtype - since filter reporting is not backwards compatible, this is probably a bump of a major version
- report (accidental) bugfix of variants with only one supporting read being missed for ALF testing due to incorrect return in alt_filter_reads() - hence higher reports of ALF in new version
- look for boundary conditions which are untested, or other untested paths which should be tested
