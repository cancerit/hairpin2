    duplication variant filter - a portion of the reads supporting the variant
    are suspected to arise from duplicated reads that have escaped dupmarking.

    In regions of low complexity, short repeats and homopolymer tracts can cause PCR stuttering.
    Leading to, for example, an additional A on the read when amplifying a tract of As.
    If duplicated reads contain stutter, this can lead to variation of read length and alignment to reference
    between reads that are in fact duplicates. Because of this, these duplicates then evade dupmarking and give rise to
    spurious variants when calling.

    `min_boundary_deviation` sets the minimum deviation start/end coordinates, above which reads are assumed not to be duplicated
    `read_number_difference_threshold` sets the the threshold for absolute difference between the number of reads supporting the variant
    with and without duplicates removed. If this threshold is exceeded, the flag will be set.
