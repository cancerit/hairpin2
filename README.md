# hairpin2
`hairpin2` – CLI implementation of the hairpin detection algorithm concieved by [Ellis et al, 2020](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41596-020-00437-6).

`hairpin2` is designed to flag variants with anomalous distributions indicating that they are likely artefactual. Initially, it was concieved to flag possible cruciform artefacts for LCM sequence data, but the concept has been extended to other artefacts including artefactual indels. It operates on a VCF file containing one or more samples, and alignment files for all samples to be tested.

Given a VCF, and BAM files for the samples of that VCF, return a VCF with variants flagged with `ADF` if variants have anomalous distributions indicating that they are likely to be artefactual, and `ALF` if relevant reads have lower median alignment score per base than a specified threshold.

The `ALF` filter indicates variants which occur with poor signal-to-noise, and also provides additional confidence in the `ADF` filter – artefacts with anomalous distributions often cause a marked decrease in alignment score, as is the case for cruciform artefacts.


### DEPENDENCIES
* Python >= 3.10 – required
* pysam >= 0.22.1 – installed automatically during install process (tested with 0.22.1 only)
* pytest >= 0.8.2.2 - optional, only necessary to run tests

### INSTALLATION
Within a virtual environment:
```
python -m venv .env
source .env/bin/activate
pip install .
hairpin -h
```

For system-wide access:
```
export INST_PATH=/path/to/install/location/
mkdir -p $INST_PATH
pip install . --target $INST_PATH
export PATH=${PATH}:${INST_PATH}/bin
hairpin -h
```

### ASSUMPTIONS & LIMITATIONS
`hairpin2` is designed for paired data where alignment records have the `MC` tag and the complete CIGAR string is present in the `CIGAR` field (rather than the `CG:B,I` tag). If the `MC` tag is not present in your data, it can be added using `samtools fixmate` or `biobambam2 bamsormadup`. The tool can handle substitions, insertions, and deletions formatted per the VCF specification. At this time, the tool will not investigate mutations notated with angle brackets, e.g. `<DEL>`, complex mutations, or monomorphic reference. No further assumptions are made – other alignment tags and VCF fields are used, however they are mandatory per the relevant format specifications. If these requirements are limiting and you need the tool to be extended in some way, please request it.

```

Parameters are hopefully mostly clear from the helptext, but some warrant further explanation:

- --name-mapping – some variant callers, for example caveman, output sample names such as "TUMOUR" in VCF header columns. hairpin2 uses these column names to match to BAM samples via the SM tag - if these fields do not match, you'll need to provide a mapping here, for example "TUMOR:PD3738..."
- --al-filter-threshold – the default value of 0.93 was arrived at by trial and error – since different aligners/platforms calculate alignment score differently, you may want to modify this value appropriately. In past implementations, where this value was known as `ASRD`, the default was set at 0.87.
- --max-read-span – long homopolymer tracts can cause stuttering, where a PCR duplicate will have, for example, an additional A in a tract of As. These reads will align a base or two earlier on the reference genome than they should. As a result pcr duplicate flag machinery fails and they are not flagged as duplicates. `hairpin2` will attempt to filter out these duplicates, and MAX_READ_SPAN is then the maximum +- position to use during duplicate detection.

The parameters available for the ADF flag are probably best understood by reading the implementation of the function `is_variant_AD()` in `hairpin2/main.py`.

The tool tests records in a VCF file and applies the `ADF` and `ALF` filter flags as appropriate. Reasoning for decisions is recorded in the INFO field of the VCF records, in the form `ADF=<alt>|<True/False>|<code>` and `ALF=<alt>|<True/False>|<code>|<median AS score>`. The codes are as follows:  

> **0** – passed/failed on condition 60A(i) of Ellis et al. (`ADF` only)  
> **1** – passed/failed on condition 60B(i) of Ellis et al. (`ADF` only)  
> **2** – passed/failed on filter threshold (`ALF` only)  
> **3** – insufficient appropriate reads to support calling flag – this covers a lot of possiblities, if more granularity is desired, please request it  
> **4** – no samples have non 0,0 genotype for the record  

The basic procedure of this implementation is as follows:  
>   For each record in the VCF, test every alt for that record as follows:  
>   1. for samples exhibiting the mutation, retrieve reads covering the region
>   2. test each read for validity for use in distribution testing (i.e. base quality, do they express the correct alt, and so on)
>   3. performing statistical analysis on aggregates of the position of the mutation relative to the start and end of the aligned portion of the reads
>   4. on the results of the statistical analysis, pass or fail the record for the filters `ALF` and `ADF`, and log a code and relevant info to the `INFO` field indicating the reason for the decision  

The code has been written with the intention of clarity and extensibility – again, further understanding may be achieved by reading `hairpin2/main.py`.


### TESTING
A test suite has been provided to prove the validity of the algorithm, i.e. to prove that it does what it claims to do. To run these tests run `pytest -m "validate"` from within the install directory. `hairpin2` must have been installed from that same directory, and be available on path (for example in a virtual environment). The tests can be found in the `test` directory. The basic premise is that of basis path testing. This approach means the focus is on testing all nodes (statements) and edges (paths between statements), rather than trying every possible input combination. Since all input possibilities will pass via the same network/graph, if we prove that each part of that network functions correctly, we can be sure that the program functions as it claims to. The tests are simple, and, once you have read them, it should be very easy to add your own further tests should you feel the need to further confirm any behaviour.
