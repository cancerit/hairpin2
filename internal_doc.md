### INTRODUCTION

`hairpin2` - CLI implementation of the hairpin detection algorithm concieved by [Ellis et al, 2020](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41596-020-00437-6). Implemented by Peter Campbell and Alex Byrne (primary contact for this tool - ab63).

For paired data, given a VCF, and BAM files for the samples of that VCF, return a VCF with variants flagged with `HPF` if they are suspected cruciform artefacts, and `ALF` if relevant reads have lower median alignment score per base than a specified threshold. The `ALF` filter indicates poor signal-to-noise, and provides additional confidence in the `HPF` filter – cruciform artefacts usually cause a marked decrease in alignment score. The `ALF` flag also may appear on variants without `HPF`, often indicating other artefacts associated with poor signal-to-noise.

`hairpin2` has been designed to replace `AdditionalBamStatistics`, which forms a key part of the the LCM processing pipelines known as "Mathijs' Scripts" and "Tim Butler's scripts" (there may also be other names and other pipelines which incoroprate this tool). 

Improvements and differences to the original `AdditionalBamStatistics` implementation include:
- No more ambiguous/cryptic/unfixable errors – the tool should work on all appropriate data, and if it is unable to produce the expected output it will clearly inform the user (but see N.B. at end of this section)
- Transparency – reasoning for flagging decisions logged in VCF
- Centrally maintained and versioned – for reproducibility/citing/distribution
- Significant speedup (on testing data at least) – 50s runtime on 542-variant caveman VCF
- The module adds **filter flags**, `HPF` and `ALF`, to a VCF. It **does not** output into separate files containing passed and failed positions
- The `ALF` flag supersedes the `ASRD` info field

**N.B.** this program is currently in an alpha/testing phase – it is available on the farm, but is likely to change, or have new features added, rapidly, per user responses. **It also may be broken in some way; if so please get in touch**. It is not currently publicly available – it will be made public as soon as it is out of this alpha phase.


### MODULE ACCESS

For local or VM use, see README for install instructions.
For farm22 use, available as a module.
```
module avail hairpin2
module load <version>
```
**N.B. do not confuse with the module `hairpin` – this is `hairpin2`**. `hairpin` was a stopgap version of Mathijs' Scripts that relied on some of Mathijs' original code, and was unreliable and error prone.


### ASSUMPTIONS

`hairpin2` is designed for paired data where alignment records have the `MC` tag and the complete CIGAR string is present in the `CIGAR` field (rather than the `CG:B,I` tag). If the `MC` tag is not present in your data, it can be added using `samtools fixmate` or `biobambam2 bamsormadup`. No further assumptions are made – other alignment tags and VCF fields are used, however they are mandatory per the relevant format specifications.

```

**N.B.** the above usage block indicates the call for the tool is `hairpin2` – this is correct for local/vm installs, but for farm usage, for the time being, it is `hairpin2-alpha`

Parameters are hopefully mostly clear from the helptext, but some warrant further explanation:

- `--al-filter-threshold` – the default value of 0.93 was arrived at by trial and error – since different aligners/platforms calculate alignment score differently, you may want to modify this value appropriately. In "Mathijs' Scripts", the default was set at 0.87 for filtering on `ASRD`.  
- `--max-read-span` – long homopolymer tracts can cause stuttering, where a PCR duplicate will have, for example, an additional A in a tract of As. These reads will align a base or two earlier on the reference genome than they should. As a result pcr duplicate flag machinery fails and they are not flagged as duplicates. `MAX_READ_SPAN` is then the maximum +- position to use when detecting PCR duplicates.  
- `--position-fraction` – cruciform artefacts usually contain segments that do not align to the reference genome, resulting in the segment being soft-clipped. The subsequent aligned portion will then contain false variants, which arise from the artefact. These false variants appear with anomalous regularity at alignment boundaries – unlike true variants. If, for a given variant, more than 90% of the variant bases are within `POSITION_FRACTION` of read edges, allow for calling `HPF` flag.

(pre)filtering is not performed by this module, as the filtering is not relevant to hairpin detection and should be performed separately. Filtering can be performed using the `vcfilter` or `bcftools` modules.  



### DETAILS

The tool tests records in a VCF file and applies the `HPF` and `ALF` filter flags as appropriate. Reasoning for decisions is recorded in the INFO field of the VCF records, in the form `HPF=<alt>|<code>` and `ALF=<alt>|<code>|<median AS score>`. The codes are as follows:  

**0** – passed/failed on condition 60A(i) of Ellis et al. (`HPF` only)  
**1** – passed/failed on condition 60B(i) of Ellis et al. (`HPF` only)  
**2** – passed/failed on filter threshold (`ALF` only)  
**3** – insufficient appropriate reads to support calling flag – this covers a lot of possiblities, if more granularity is desired, please request it  
**4** – no samples have non 0,0 genotype for the record  
  

The basic procedure of this implementation is as follows. For each record in the VCF, test every alt for that record by:  
1. retrieving reads from samples exhibiting the mutations
2. testing each read for validity for use in hairpin testing (i.e. base quality, do they express the correct alt, and so on)
3. performing statistical analysis on aggregates of the position of the mutation relative to the start and end of the aligned portion of the reads
4. on the results of the statistical analysis, pass or fail the record for the filters `ALF` and `HPF`, and log a code and relevant info to the `INFO` field indicating the reason for the decision

The code has been written with the intention of clarity and extensibility – further understanding may be achieved by reading `hairpin2/main.py`.
